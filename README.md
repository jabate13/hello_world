Hello World (of github)!!

I am fairly new to programming. It's been a little less than a year since I started seriously learning, and not just using code to help solve a problem.

I am very interested in artificial intelligance, and I love mauling over a good math problem, you know, for the fun of it.

Anyway, I'm not sure how many people will read this, so I'm not putting any effort into it. ha
